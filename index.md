Welcome to the HeatHack programme for UK community building operators. This is the “Guide Book” for participating venues. It explains the programme and provides links to all publicly available materials for it. We developed this programme with support from the Royal Academy of Engineering Ingenious programme. We are very grateful to them.

We haven’t put these materials behind a password or paywall because we know barriers put people off. Anyone can use our materials to run the programme - or any way they like as long as they credit us and share any improvements! We ask in return that if you use what we provide, you register with us. Otherwise it’s hard for us to attract the funding we need to serve you better.
